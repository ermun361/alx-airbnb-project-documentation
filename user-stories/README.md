# User Stories Documentation

This directory contains the user stories derived from the system's use case diagram.

The main file, `user-stories.md`, documents the core features and functionalities of the ALX Airbnb project from the perspective of its users (Guests, Hosts, and Administrators). These stories serve as a foundation for the development backlog.
